# Matrix-Addition
This program performs the addition of two matrices. It starts by asking the user to input values for two matrices, `matrice 1` and `matrice 2`, each with 5 rows and 4 columns. It then calculates the sum of these two matrices element-wise and stores the result in a third matrix `s`. Finally, it prints the resulting matrix.
